*Collate and display CPU fuzzing logs*

[Sandsifter](https://github.com/xoreaxeaxeax/sandsifter) fuzzes CPUs and produces logs.
The project gives an email address where you can send those logs, but the author seems to have vanished.
Perhaps if a good visualization webapp is available, people will use this!

## Backlog
